# ðŸ’Ž Spellstone-ingest
Spellstone is a collection of tools for ingesting, processing, and interacting with your personal knowledge base. It is a modular system that can be run in the cloud or locally. It uses Obsidian vault as a storage backend.

Spellstone-ingest is the ingestion part of the system, responsible for fetching data from various sources and storing it in the Obsidian vault. It can be both triggered manually and run on a schedule.

Feel free to modify the flows, add your own flows, and send me a pull request if you think it would be useful for others.

## Installation
This is a modular system, so depending on what you want to run, you need to install different parts of it.

### Cloud installation
For most clouds, it should be sufficient to just push the git repo and let them build everything for you. This, for example, works for [Railway](https://railway.app/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), and others. The repo already has the Dockerfile and Makefile provided.

So all you need is to set up the API keys as described above.

### Local installation
#### Install external libraries
- ffmpeg (Debian: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`)

#### Set up Poetry
```console
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry --version
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

#### Set up Python environment
(in the project folder)
```console
poetry install --with=bot,dev,test,dashboard,etl,tools --no-root
poetry run pre-commit install
```
OR
```console
make env
```

#### Debugging in VSCode
When debugging, select "Python: Module" configuration.

### AI module

#### Get OpenAI API key
Set up your own OpenAI account. Visit [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) in your OpenAI account to create a new API key.

#### Set up API keys for the bot
The bot requires some API keys to run. There are two ways of providing them:
- environment variables. Provide the env variables listed in `template.env`. This option is more convenient for a cloud installation.
- `.env` file in the project root. You should manually create it. I do not provide my own `.env` file because of security reasons, but I put `template.env` as a template for the keys required. This option is better suited for a local installation.

## Enjoy!
